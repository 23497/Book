            <p>Gas Giants are planets that are mostly made out of gas, not very dense but a lot of mass.</p>
            <p> Gas giants don't have a surface but more likely to have liquid Ocean of different elements.</p>
            <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system with gravity 3 times stronger than on earth.</p>
            <p> Jupiter helps earth by consuming asteroids that try to go to earth. 79 moons Orbit Jupiter and</p>
            <p>the moon called Europa is known to have “life” on it. It has the mass of two and a half of all</p>
            <br>
            <img src="jupiter.png" id="picture1">
            <p>planets in our solar system. There are constant storms on Jupiter full of lightning and</p>
            <p>strong winds. Sometimes Jupiter is called a failed star or a brown dwarf because it does</p>
            <p>not have enough materials to fuse into a star. The storm on Jupiter called the great Red spot,</p>
            <p>has been around for 300 years and can fit 3 earths inside of it. It's shrinking slowly.</p>
            <p>Mostly hydrogen and helium is in the atmosphere of jupiter. The atmosphere pressure turns</p>
            <p>the gas into liquids</p>

            <p id="E">Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun at 919.57 million miles far and the second-largest in </p>
            <p id="E">the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and</p>
            <p id="E">a half times that of Earth. It only has one-eighth the average density of Earth, being the least</p>
            <p id="E">dense planet. The planet is actulay buoyant on water. However, with its larger volume, Saturn </p>
            <p id="E">is over 95 times more massive. The radius of the rings on Saturn is 46390 miles which is the farthest</p>
            <p id="E">ring from the planet. The Rings of saturn are suprisingly thin and made out of small pieces of ice</p>
            <br>
            <img src="saturn.png" id="piture2">
            <p id="E">and rocks. The 82 moons of saturn sometimes collide with the rings but are too small to disturb it.</p>
            <p id="E">The biggest moon in the solar system called Titan which is estimated to have life on it. Saturn is</p>
            <p id="E">very releated to Jupiter and is big and instead of a hard surface it has liquid oceans. The lowest</p>
            <p id="E">temperatures record in Saturn is -220 degrees farenheight and highest of 280 degrees farenheight.</p>
