            <p>Mercury is the closest planet to the sun and is not the hottest planet.</p>
            <p>Mercury has a diameter of 4880 kilometers(3032 miles) or three quarters of the United States.</p>
            <p>The temperatures go up to 880 degrees farenheight, at it's lowest is -260 degrees farenheiht.</p>
            <p>To survive you have to be running 29+ miles per second and if you go too far you freeze and too</p>
            <p> slow you might burn to death. It is not a nice plaxe to be but has a lot of recources.</p>

            <p>	The gravitational force on Mercury is 0.38 times Earth's gravity, which means if you weighed </p>
            <p>100 lbs you would only weigh 38 lbs which makes things easier if you are lazy. Mercury has the</p>
            <p>least craters in our solar system with only 414 craters,  which is 5x less than our moon. The atmosphere</p>
            <p>is being blown away because of the sun and making it more exposed of solar flares. recources like</p>
            <p>2/3s of iron-alloy core and has an uncompressed density of 5.3 (Earth is just 4.08), which makes it</p>
            <p>the densest planet.</p>

            <p id="E">The planet is the only planet being named after the greek goddes of beauty, Venus. Did you know that a</p>
            <p id="E">day on Venus is longer than ayear because the planet spins clockwise rather than anti-clockwise. The at-</p>
            <p id="E">-mosphere on the planet is chaotic with winds up to 450mph, the densest clouds, 90 times the air pressure,</p>
            <p id="E"> and sulfaric acid raining instead of water, plus very rocky terain with the most mountains and volcanoes </p>
            <p id="E">and 900 degrees farenheight and more recorded. There were only 10 rovers that survived for 110 minutes.</p>

            <p id="E">Venus has a near perfect sphere shape after Mercury and Pluto. Along with the dense clouds of sulfaric acid,</p>
            <p id="E">Venus has carbon dioxide all over it's atmospher making a strong greenhouse effect, rising the temperature.</p>
            <p id="E">The surface used to have life on it full of water and today we think there might be microbial life in it's clouds.</p>
